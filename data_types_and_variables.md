## Variable
**Other languages have variables, python has names.** In Python, every value has a datatype, but you don’t need to declare the datatype of variables.
```
x
x = 2
```

## Data types
* **Numbers** can be integers (1 and 2), floats (1.1 and 1.2), fractions (1/2 and 2/3), or even complex numbers.
* **Booleans** are either True or False.
* **Strings** are sequences of Unicode characters, e.g. an html document.
* **Bytes** and byte arrays, e.g. a jpeg image file.
* **Lists** are ordered sequences of values.
* **Tuples** are ordered, immutable sequences of values.
* **Sets** are unordered bags of values.
* **Dictionaries** are unordered bags of key-value pairs.

## Numbers
* Integers are signed can be of any length, it is only limited by the memory available
* A floating point number is accurate up to 15 decimal places
* There’s no type declaration to distinguish int and float. Python apart them by the presence or absence of a decimal point
* Complex numbers are written in the form, x + yj, where x is the real part and y is the imaginary part
```
a = 10	 	 	   // Signed Integer
a = 345L	 	 	 // (L) Long integers, they can also be represented in octal and hexadecimal
a = 2.45	 	 	 // (.) Floating point real values
a = 1 + 2j	 	 // (J) Contains integer in the range 0 to 255.
```
