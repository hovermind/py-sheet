* Tuples are immutable, which means their values at the indices cannot be changed, unless there is a value swap
* The array index range is from 0 to size minus 1. Negative indices start at the end of the array and work backwards
* Tuples can be combined using the addition operator
* When declaring a tuple, the parentheses are optional
```
tuple_name = (item1, item2, item3)
val = tuple_name[index]  #accessing item at index

cities = ("Toronto", "Tokyo", "London", "Sydney")
tokyo = cities[1]
```
