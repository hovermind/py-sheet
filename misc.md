## Style guide
[Google Python Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html) has the following convention:
```
module_name
package_name
ClassName
method_name
ExceptionName
function_name
GLOBAL_CONSTANT_NAME
global_var_name
instance_var_name
function_parameter_name
local_var_name
```
A similar naming scheme should be applied to a `CLASS_CONSTANT_NAME`    

[Python PEP 8](http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/)
Function names should be lowercase, with words separated by underscores as necessary to improve readability.
mixedCase is allowed only in contexts where that's already the prevailing style
