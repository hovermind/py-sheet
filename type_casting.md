## implicit casting
Adding an int to a float yields a float. Python coerces the int into a float to perform the addition, then returns a float as the result.

## Explicit casting
* The int() function will truncate, not round.
* The int() function truncates negative numbers towards 0. Itâ€™s a true truncate function, not a floor function.
