## What is matrix
A matrix is a two-dimensional data structure (row x columns) in which all rows (nested items) have same number of elements. In python, matrix is a nested list.    

**2-D matrix**
```
a = [[80, 75, 85],
     [75, 80, 99],
     [79, 91, 87]]
```
**Nested list but not a matrix**
```
b = [[80, 75, 85],
     [75, 80, 99],
     [79, 91]]
```
All nested items in `a` have same number of elements while 3rd item in `b` have fewer elements than other two, that's why `b` is not a matrix.
