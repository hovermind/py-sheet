## What is matrix
A matrix is a two-dimensional data structure (row x column) in which all rows (nested items) have same number of elements. In python, matrix is a nested list.    

**2-D matrix**
```
A = [[80, 75, 85],
     [75, 80, 99],
     [79, 91, 87]]
```
**Nested list but not a matrix**
```
B = [[80, 75, 85],
     [75, 80, 99],
     [79, 91]]
```
`A` is a matrix as well as nested list where as `B` is a nested list but not a matrix because 3rd item in `B` has fewer elements than other two.
